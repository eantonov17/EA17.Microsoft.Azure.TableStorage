# EA17.Microsoft.Azure.TableStorage
C# .Net Core library to simplify work with Microsoft Azure TableStorage

Some of issues solved:
1) track of values loaded from a table. if a value has been changed then an update will include it, if not the value is excluded - 
this reduces traffic and cost
2) vlaues tracked o nthe object level
3) automatic conversion to/from table data types

I'll add more as i progress through refactorinf older code and adding it here
